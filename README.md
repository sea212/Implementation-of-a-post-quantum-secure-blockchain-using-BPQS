# Implementation-of-a-post-quantum-secure-blockchain-using-BPQS
This repository contains the documentation of a post-quantum secure ledger I implemented during a course in university. It uses my WOTS Python as the pqc signature library. The code is not included in this project, since it honestly was created in the last week after implementing the WOTS python package and planing the whole design. It therefore needs to be rewritten to be of any help. Nevertheless, it showed that this POC is possible. The Signature size was 4kB at max, 2 kB optimally. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bgd-V7Hsh4 to see a video showing and describing the PoC implementation
